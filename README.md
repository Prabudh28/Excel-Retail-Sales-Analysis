# Excel-Retail-Sales-Analysis
An end-to-end analysis of a UK online retailer's sales data, using Power Query, Pivot Tables, and interactive dashboards to derive business insights.


# Online Retail Transaction Analysis
Tool: Microsoft Excel
Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth audit and analysis of over 540,000 sales transactions from a real UK-based online retailer. The goal was to leverage advanced Excel functionalities to clean, process, and analyse the dataset to uncover actionable business insights, focusing on revenue concentration and inventory management.

Tools & Techniques Used
Data Cleaning & ETL: Power Query was used to import the raw CSV data, handle missing values, filter out cancelled transactions and duplicates, and transform the data into a clean, analysis-ready format.

Data Analysis: Pivot Tables were used to aggregate and segment the data, allowing for a deep dive into product performance and revenue metrics.

Key Metrics Calculated: A Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule) was conducted to identify the top products contributing to the majority of the revenue.

Reporting & Visualization: An Interactive Dashboard was built, featuring Pivot Charts and Slicers to provide a dynamic and user-friendly view of the key findings.

Key Findings & Insights
Revenue Concentration (Pareto Principle): The analysis confirmed that a small subset of products drives the majority of income. Specifically, the top 20% of products were found to contribute to approximately 80% of the total revenue. This insight is critical for strategic procurement, marketing focus, and stock prioritisation.

Slow-Moving Inventory Identified: A report was generated to highlight the slowest-moving goods (products with the lowest sales quantity). This automated report provides the business with a clear list of products that may require marketing promotions, bundling, or potential discontinuation to optimize inventory turnover.

Geographic Sales Insights: Using interactive slicers, the dashboard allows for a quick breakdown of sales performance by country, revealing key markets and potential areas for business growth.
